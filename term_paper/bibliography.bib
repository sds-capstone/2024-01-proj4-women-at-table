    abstract = "{Financial inclusion has become an important policy objective in recent years in a number of developing and developed countries. It is increasingly viewed as a tool of poverty alleviation, enables the poor to be risk averse and allows investment in health and education. However, including a large number of different groups of the population within the financial system if not accompanied by the appropriate regulatory measures could pose a risk to the country’s financial stability. Financial stability too has assumed increased importance in recent years especially since the financial crisis. A dilemma among policymakers is how to achieve a balance between the two and how to promote financial inclusion without destabilizing the financial system. In this study we explore the state of financial inclusion and financial stability in the context of BRICS.}",

abstract = {One of the main lines of research in algorithmic fairness involves individual fairness (IF) methods. Individual fairness is motivated by an intuitive principle, similar treatment, which requires that similar individuals be treated similarly. IF offers a precise account of this principle using distance metrics to evaluate the similarity of individuals. Proponents of individual fairness have argued that it gives the correct definition of algorithmic fairness, and that it should therefore be preferred to other methods for determining fairness. I argue that individual fairness cannot serve as a definition of fairness. Moreover, IF methods should not be given priority over other fairness methods, nor used in isolation from them. To support these conclusions, I describe four in-principle problems for individual fairness as a definition and as a method for ensuring fairness: (1) counterexamples show that similar treatment (and therefore IF) are insufficient to guarantee fairness; (2) IF methods for learning similarity metrics are at risk of encoding human implicit bias; (3) IF requires prior moral judgments, limiting its usefulness as a guide for fairness and undermining its claim to define fairness; and (4) the incommensurability of relevant moral values makes similarity metrics impossible for many tasks. In light of these limitations, I suggest that individual fairness cannot be a definition of fairness, and instead should be seen as one tool among several for ameliorating algorithmic bias.},

abstract = {This paper critically examines arguments against independence, a measure of group fairness also known as statistical parity and as demographic parity. In recent discussions of fairness in computer science, some have maintained that independence is not a suitable measure of group fairness. This position is at least partially based on two influential papers (Dwork et al., 2012, Hardt et al., 2016) that provide arguments against independence. We revisit these arguments, and we find that the case against independence is rather weak. We also give arguments in favor of independence, showing that it plays a distinctive role in considerations of fairness. Finally, we discuss how to balance different fairness considerations.},
